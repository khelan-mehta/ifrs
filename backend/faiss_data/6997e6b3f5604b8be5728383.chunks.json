The Committee's recommendations were adopted by\nthe full Board in all instances.\n2.2 Management Accountability\nThe Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), Maria Torres, reports directly to the CEO and is a member of\nthe Executive Leadership Team (ELT). The CSO is responsible for integrating sustainability\nconsiderations into strategic planning, capital allocation, and operational decision-making.\nSustainability KPIs are embedded in the annual performance objectives of all ELT members, with\n20% of short-term incentive compensation linked to climate and sustainability metrics.\nThe Sustainability Working Group, comprising 28 members from operations, finance, legal, risk, and\ninvestor relations, meets monthly to coordinate implementation of the sustainability strategy.\nRegional sustainability leads in each of the Company's 14 operating countries report to the CSO\nthrough a matrix structure.\n2.3 Governance Structure\nBody\nRole\nFrequency\nBoard of Directors\nUltimate oversight of sustainability risks/opportunities\nQuarterly\nSustainability Committee\nDetailed review, target setting, policy approval\nQuarterly + ad hoc\nExecutive Leadership Team\nStrategic integration, capital allocation\nMonthly\nSustainability Working Group\nCross-functional implementation coordination\nMonthly\nRegional Sustainability Leads\nLocal execution and compliance\nWeekly reporting\n\n3. Strategy\nIFRS S1 Pillar: Strategy\n3.1 Sustainability-Related Risks and Opportunities\nThe Company has identified material sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could\nreasonably be expected to affect its cash flows, access to finance, or cost of capital over the short\nterm (0-2 years), medium term (2-10 years), and long term (10-30 years). The most significant risks\ninclude physical climate impacts on coastal and water-dependent assets, regulatory transition risks\nfrom evolving carbon pricing mechanisms, and technology disruption risks in the rapidly evolving\nenergy storage market.\nKey opportunities include accelerating demand for renewable energy driven by government net-zero\ncommitments, the growing green bond and sustainable finance market, carbon credit generation\nfrom nature-based solutions, and emerging revenue streams from green hydrogen production. The\nCompany estimates that climate-related opportunities could contribute an additional GBP 800\nmillion to annual revenue by 2030 under a 1.5 degrees C scenario.\n3.2 Business Model Impact\nClimate change affects GreenTech's business model across the entire value chain. On the supply\nside, increased frequency of extreme weather events has disrupted equipment supply chains\n(estimated impact: GBP 45 million in FY2024). On the demand side, growing policy support for\ndecarbonization has driven a 34% increase in power purchase agreement (PPA) volumes. The\nCompany's transition from fossil fuel generation (now 12% of capacity, down from 28% in 2020) to\n100% renewables by 2035 requires estimated capital expenditure of GBP 4.2 billion over the period\n2025-2035.\n3.3 Financial Planning Impact\nArea\nImpact Description\nFinancial Effect (GBP m)\nCapital Expenditure\nAccelerated renewable buildout, grid modernization\n620 (FY2024)\nOperating Costs\nCarbon pricing exposure (EU ETS, UK ETS)\n38 (FY2024)\nRevenue Opportunity\nNew PPA contracts, green hydrogen pilots\n+280 (FY2024)\nAsset Impairment\nStranded gas assets write-down\n-95 (FY2024)\nInsurance Costs\nIncreased premiums for coastal/flood-exposed assets\n12 (FY2024)\nGreen Financing\n", "penditure\nAccelerated renewable buildout, grid modernization\n620 (FY2024)\nOperating Costs\nCarbon pricing exposure (EU ETS, UK ETS)\n38 (FY2024)\nRevenue Opportunity\nNew PPA contracts, green hydrogen pilots\n+280 (FY2024)\nAsset Impairment\nStranded gas assets write-down\n-95 (FY2024)\nInsurance Costs\nIncreased premiums for coastal/flood-exposed assets\n12 (FY2024)\nGreen Financing\nGreen bond proceeds at favorable rates\n1,200 (issued FY2024)\n\n4. Risk Management\nIFRS S1 Pillar: Risk Management\n4.1 Risk Identification Process\nGreenTech employs a comprehensive enterprise risk management (ERM) framework that integrates\nclimate and sustainability risks into the broader risk taxonomy. Climate-related risks are identified\nthrough a combination of top-down scenario analysis, bottom-up asset-level vulnerability\nassessments, and horizon scanning of regulatory and technological developments. The Company\nengages external climate scientists and risk consultants (including Willis Towers Watson and Marsh\nMcLennan) to supplement internal capabilities.\nAll identified risks are assessed on a 5-point scale for both likelihood and impact (financial,\noperational, reputational, and regulatory dimensions). Risks scoring 4 or above on either dimension\nare escalated to the Board Sustainability Committee. In FY2024, 23 climate-related risks were\nidentified, of which 7 were classified as 'High' or 'Critical'.\n4.2 Risk Assessment Matrix\nRisk Category\nLikelihood (1-5)\nImpact (1-5)\nRating\nTrend\nExtreme weather damage to assets\n4\n5\nCritical\nIncreasing\nCarbon pricing increases (EU/UK ETS)\n5\n4\nCritical\nIncreasing\nWater scarcity at generation sites\n3\n4\nHigh\nIncreasing\nTechnology obsolescence (storage)\n3\n3\nMedium\nStable\nSupply chain disruption\n4\n3\nHigh\nIncreasing\nRegulatory non-compliance penalties\n2\n5\nHigh\nStable\nReputational risk (greenwashing)\n2\n4\nMedium\nIncreasing\n4.3 Integration with Enterprise Risk\nClimate risks are fully integrated into GreenTech's enterprise risk register and are reviewed\nalongside financial, operational, and strategic risks in quarterly risk committee meetings. The Chief\nRisk Officer and CSO jointly present integrated risk assessments to the Board, ensuring that climate\nconsiderations are embedded in all major investment decisions exceeding GBP 10 million. The\nCompany's internal audit function conducts annual reviews of climate risk management processes.\n\n5.

Climate-Related Disclosures\nIFRS S2: Climate-Related Disclosures\nThis section provides climate-specific disclosures in accordance with IFRS S2. The Company\nrecognizes climate change as the most significant sustainability-related risk to its business model\nand has embedded climate considerations into every aspect of its strategy, operations, and\ngovernance.\n6.1 Climate-Related Risks\nThe Company faces both physical and transition climate risks. Physical risks include acute risks\nsuch as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and wildfires affecting generation\nassets and grid infrastructure, as well as chronic risks including rising sea levels threatening coastal\ninstallations, changing precipitation patterns affecting hydroelectric output, and increasing\ntemperatures reducing the efficiency of solar panels and thermal cooling systems.\nTransition risks encompass policy and legal risks from evolving carbon pricing and emissions\nregulations, technology risks from rapid evolution in battery storage and green hydrogen, market\nrisks from shifting energy demand patterns and commodity price volatility, and reputational risks\nassociated with the pace and credibility of the Company's decarbonization commitments.\n6.2 Climate-Related Opportunities\nOpportunity\nTime Horizon\nEstimated Revenue Impact\nExpanded renewable PPA contracts\nShort-term (0-2 yr)\nGBP 350m p.a. by 2026\nGreen hydrogen production\nMedium-term (2-10 yr)\nGBP 200m p.a. by 2030\nCarbon credit generation (nature-based)\nMedium-term\nGBP 50m p.a. by 2028\nGrid-scale battery storage\nShort-medium term\nGBP 180m p.a. by 2027\nSustainable aviation fuel partnerships\nLong-term (10+ yr)\nGBP 120m p.a. by 2035\n\n7. Physical Risk Assessment\n7.1 Asset Exposure Analysis\nGreenTech conducted a comprehensive physical risk assessment across its global asset portfolio\nusing high-resolution climate models (CMIP6 ensemble, downscaled to 5km resolution). The\nassessment covered all material assets including 42 wind farms, 18 solar installations, 6\nhydroelectric facilities, 3 gas-fired power stations (scheduled for decommission by 2032), and 2,400\nkm of grid infrastructure.\nHazard\nAssets Exposed\n", "\n7.1 Asset Exposure Analysis\nGreenTech conducted a comprehensive physical risk assessment across its global asset portfolio\nusing high-resolution climate models (CMIP6 ensemble, downscaled to 5km resolution).

Transition Risk Assessment\n8.1 Policy and Regulatory Risks\nThe Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with evolving carbon pricing and emissions\nregulations. In FY2024, carbon costs under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and UK\nEmissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) totaled GBP 38 million, up from GBP 24 million in FY2023.\nUnder the Company's central scenario, carbon prices are projected to reach EUR 120/tCO2e by\n2030 and EUR 180/tCO2e by 2040, resulting in estimated cumulative exposure of GBP 420 million\nover 2025-2035 if current emission levels were maintained. The Company's decarbonization\npathway reduces this exposure to an estimated GBP 185 million.\n8.2 Technology Risks\nRapid technological change in the energy sector presents both risks and opportunities. The\nCompany's current battery storage technology (lithium-ion NMC) faces potential displacement from\nemerging solid-state batteries, sodium-ion technologies, and iron-air systems. To mitigate this risk,\nGreenTech maintains technology partnerships with 6 battery manufacturers and invests GBP 35\nmillion annually in R&D; through its GreenTech Innovation Lab. The Company has also secured\ntechnology licensing agreements for two next-generation storage technologies.\n8.3 Market and Reputational Risks\nShifting energy demand patterns driven by electrification of transport and heating create both upside\nand downside risks. The Company's scenario analysis indicates that total electricity demand in its\nmarkets could increase by 40-65% by 2040. Reputational risk is managed through transparent\nreporting, third-party verification of emissions data, and active stakeholder engagement.

Forward-Looking Statements and Net Zero\nPathway\nGreenTech is committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and\n3 by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement timeline. The Company's decarbonization\npathway includes the following milestones: complete phase-out of fossil fuel generation by 2032;\n100% renewable electricity procurement by 2028; 50% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2035;\ndeployment of 2 GW of green hydrogen electrolysis capacity by 2035; and investment of GBP 4.2\nbillion in clean energy infrastructure over 2025-2035.\nThe Company acknowledges that achieving these targets depends on several external factors\nincluding government policy support, technology cost reductions, supply chain capacity, and the\npace of grid modernization. The Company will report annually on progress against these targets and\nwill update its pathway as new information becomes available. All forward-looking statements in this\nreport are based on current expectations and are subject to material risks and uncertainties.\nThis report has been approved by the Board of Directors of GreenTech Energy Holdings plc on 15\nMarch 2025. The Sustainability Committee confirms that the disclosures contained herein are\nconsistent with the information used by the Board in its strategic decision-making.\nJames Richardson\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nGreenTech Energy Holdings plc\n15 March 2025\n\nAppendix A: Methodology\nGreenhouse gas emissions have been calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate\nStandard (revised 2015) and the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard. Scope 1\nemissions include direct combustion of natural gas at thermal generation facilities and fugitive\nemissions from SF6 in electrical switchgear. Scope 2 emissions are reported on both a\nmarket-based and location-based methodology. Market-based figures reflect the purchase of\nRenewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) and contractual instruments. Scope 3 emissions\ncover 8 of the 15 GHG Protocol categories determined to be material through a screening exercise.\nPhysical risk assessments used CMIP6 climate projections (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5)\ndownscaled to 5km resolution using statistical downscaling methods. Asset-level vulnerability was\nassessed using the UNEP-FI Physical Risk Assessment Methodology. Financial impacts were\nestimated using internal damage functions calibrated against historical loss data.\nScenario analysis was conducted using the NGFS Climate Scenarios (Phase IV, released\nNovember 2023) with company-specific financial modeling. Carbon price trajectories, energy\ndemand projections, and technology cost curves were sourced from the IEA World Energy Outlook\n2024 and IRENA Renewable Power Generation Costs 2024.\nAppendix B: Independent Assurance Statement\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has performed a limited assurance engagement on selected\nsustainability metrics presented in this report for the year ended 31", " was conducted using the NGFS Climate Scenarios (Phase IV, released\nNovember 2023) with company-specific financial modeling.
